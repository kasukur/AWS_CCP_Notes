AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
=================================
 
The 5 Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework
----------------------------------------------------
1. Operational Excellence
	The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operation, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to delivery business value. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper.

	Design Principles
	There are five design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

	1. Perform operations as code
	2. Make frequent, small, reversible changes
	3. Refine operations procedures frequently
	4. Anticipate failure
	5. Learn from all operational failures
	
	Best Practices
	Operations teams need to understand their business and customer needs so they can support business outcomes. Ops creates and uses procedures to respond to operational events, and validates their effectiveness to support business needs. Ops also collects metrics that are used to measure the achievement of desired business outcomes.

	Everything continues to change—your business context, business priorities, customer needs, etc. It’s important to design operations to support evolution over time in response to change and to incorporate lessons learned through their performance.

2. Security
	The Security pillar includes the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Security Pillar white-paper.

	Design Principles
	There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:

	1. Implement a strong identity foundation
	2. Enable traceability
	3. Apply security at all layers
	4. Automate security best practices
	5. Protect data in transit and at rest
	6. Keep people away from data
	7. Prepare for security events
	
	Best Practices
	Before you architect any workload, you need to put in place practices that influence security. You’ll want to control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection.

	You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.

	The AWS Shared Responsibility Model enables organisations that adopt the cloud to achieve their security and compliance goals. Because AWS physically secures the infrastructure that supports our cloud services, as an AWS customer you can focus on using services to accomplish your goals. The AWS Cloud also provides greater access to security data and an automated approach to responding to security events.

3. Reliability
	The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Reliability Pillar white-paper.

	Design Principles
	There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:

	1. Automatically recover from failure
	2. Test recovery procedures
	3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
	4. Stop guessing capacity
	5. Manage change in automation
	
	Best Practices
	To achieve reliability, you must start with the foundations—an environment where service quotas and network topology accommodate the workload. The workload architecture of the distributed system must be designed to prevent and mitigate failures. The workload must handle changes in demand or requirements, and it must be designed to detect failure and automatically heal itself.

	Before architecting any system, foundational requirements that influence reliability should be in place. For example, you must have sufficient network bandwidth to your data center. These requirements are sometimes neglected (because they are beyond a single project’s scope).

	This neglect can have a significant impact on the ability to deliver a reliable system. In an on-premises environment, these requirements can cause long lead times due to dependencies and therefore must be incorporated during initial planning.

	With AWS, most of these foundational requirements are already incorporated or may be addressed as needed. The cloud is designed to be essentially limitless, so it is the responsibility of AWS to satisfy the requirement for sufficient networking and compute capacity, while you are free to change resource size and allocation, such as the size of storage devices, on demand.

4. Performance Efficiency
	The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Performance Efficiency Pillar whitepaper.

	Design Principles
	There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

	1. Democratize advanced technologies
	2. Go global in minutes
	3. Use serverless architectures
	4. Experiment more often
	5. Consider mechanical sympathy

	Best Practices
	Take a data-driven approach to building a high-performance architecture. Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from the high-level design to the selection and configuration of resource types.

	Reviewing your choices on a regular basis ensures you are taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring ensures you are aware of any deviance from expected performance. Make trade-offs in your architecture to improve performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing consistency requirements

	The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-Architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance

5. Cost Optimisation

	The Cost Optimisation pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. You can find prescriptive guidance on implementation in the Cost Optimisation Pillar white-paper.

	Design Principles
	There are five design principles for cost optimisation in the cloud:

	1. Implement cloud financial management
	2. Adopt a consumption model
	3. Measure overall efficiency
	4. Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
	5. Analyse and attribute expenditure

	Best Practices
	As with the other pillars, there are trade-offs to consider. For example, do you want to optimize for speed to market or for cost? In some cases, it’s best to optimize for speed—going to market quickly, shipping new features, or simply meeting a deadline—rather than investing in up-front cost optimisation.

	Design decisions are sometimes directed by haste rather than data, and as the temptation always exists to overcompensate rather than spend time benchmarking for the most cost-optimal deployment. This might lead to over-provisioned and under-optimised deployments.

	Using the appropriate services, resources, and configurations for your workloads is key to cost savings

* Billing (CloudWatch)
	- CloudWatch - To setup Billing alarm (Use the Create Alarm underneath one)

* Identity Access Management (IAM)

Summary:
1. It is Global, you do not specify a region when dealing with IAM. When you create a user or group, this is created GLOBALLY.
2. Your root account is the email address you used to set up your AWS account. The root account always has full administrator access.
You should not give these account credentials away to anyone. Instead create a user for each individual within your organisation.
You should always secure this root account using multi-factor authentication.
3. A group is simply a place to store your users. Your users will inherit all permission that the group has. 
Examples of groups might be developers, sys admins, HR, finance...etc
4. To set the permissions in a group you need to apply a policy to that group. Policies consist of Java Script Object Notation (or JSON).
These are referred to as key value pairs. You have your key, such as name and then the value. Example: {"name" : "A Cloud Guru" }

	- Allows to create users, groups and access
 		- Delete your root access keys / Rotate your access keys
		- Activate MFA on your account
			- Manage MFA (root user is the email that we used to sign-up)
                        - Click on Activate MFA (Virtual MFA (Authenticator App), U2F security key (YubiKey) and other h/w MFA device)
		- Create Individual IAM users
			- Add a user (3 ways: Programmatic access, AWS Management Console access and Amazon SDK)
			- Create a Group (3 ways: Add user to group, Copy Permission from existing user and Attach existing policies directly)
			- AWS managed have AWS icon and we can view the policy in JSON
			- Secret access key and password are shown only once when the user is created.
		- Use groups to assign permissions
		- Apply an IAM password policy
	
* S3 101 (Simple Storage Service)
	- S3 is object based - i.e. allows you to upload files. Think of Objects just as files.
	  Objects consists of the following OR The key fundamentals of S3 are:
	  	- Key (this is simply the name of the object)
 		- Value (this is simply the data and is made of a sequence of bytes) 
		- Version ID (important for versioning)
		- Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
		- Subresources:
			- Access Control Lists
			- Torrent

	- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
	- There is unlimited storage
	- Files are stored in Buckets (Bucket is like a folder in the cloud)
	- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
	  Example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
	- When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.
	
   How does data consistency work for S3?
		- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects (if you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view the data)
		- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take sometime to propagate) (If you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version, or you may not. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.)

   S3 - Guarantees
	S3 has the following guarantees from Amazon:
	- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform
	- Amazon guarantees 99.9% availability
	- Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999% durability for S3 information (Remember 11 9's)

   S3 - Features
	S3 has the following features
	- Tiered Storage Available
	- Lifecycle Management: Move objects around to two different storage tiers
	- Versioning
	- Encryption
	- MFA Delete: use MFA when deleting the files
	- Secure your data using Access Control Lists (File level) or Bucket Policies (Bucket level)

   S3 Storage Classes
	1. S3 Standard: 99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
	2. S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed): For the data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
	3. S3 One Zone IA: For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple availability zone data resilience.
	4. S3 - Intelligent Tiering: Designed to optimise costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
	5. S3 Glacier: S3 Glacier is a secure, durable and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times are configurable from minutes to hours.
	6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.
	
   S3 Charges:
	You are charged for S3 in the following ways:
	1. Storage
	2. Requests
	3. Storage Management Pricing
	4. Data Transfer Pricing
	5. Transfer Acceleration
	6. Cross Region Replication Pricing

   S3 Transfer Acceleration
	1. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.
	2. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimised network path.

   S3 Exam Tips:
	1. Remember that S3 is Object-based: i.e allows you to upload files.
	2. Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	3. There is unlimited storage.
	4. Files are stored in Buckets.
	5. S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally. Example: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
	6. Not suitable to install operating systems on S3 due to it being object based (not block storage - EBS), can only be used to store files
	7. Successful upload will generate a HTTP 200 status code.
	8. You can turn on MFA delete to avoid accidental delete. 
	9. The key fundamentals of S3 are:
		- Key (This is simply the name of the object)
		- Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes).
	10. S3 Model: 
		- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects (if you write a new files and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view the data)
		- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take sometime to propagate) (If you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version, or you may not. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.)

		7. S3 Outposts for on-premises object storage to meet data residency needs

   S3 Bucket Exam Tips:
	12. Bucket names share a common name space, you can't have the same bucket name as the others.
	13. When you view Buckets you view them globally but you can have buckets in individual regions
	14. We can use cross region replication to replicate buckets automatically to different regions.
	15. We can change storage class and encryption on the fly.
	16. Transfer acceleration
	17. Restricting Bucket Access:
		1. Bucket Policies - Applies across the bucket.
		2. Object Policies - Applies to individual files.
		3. IAM Policies to Users & Groups - Applies to Users & Groups.
	18. By default Buckets are not public.
	19. You can use bucket policies to make entire S3 buckets public.
	20. You can use S3 bucket to host static websites but can't host dynamic websites or websites which require database, for ex: Wordpress...etc.

* CloudFront
	CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

  CloudFront - Key Terminology:
	1. Edge location: This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ.
	2. Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53.
	3. Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge locations.

	When the first user queries for a file, it gets downloaded from the server. The second user gets a cached copy from the Edge Location instead of downloading it again from the server. The file has Time to live defined usually 48 hours.	

	2 types of distribution:
	Web Distribution - Typically used for Websites
	RTMP - Used for Media Streaming

 * CloudFront Exam Tips
	1. Edge location: This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ.
	2. Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53.
	3. Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge locations.

	2 types of distribution:
	Web Distribution - Typically used for Websites
	RTMP - Used for Media Streaming

	Note: 
	1. Edge Locations are not just READ only - you can write them too. (ie Put an object on to them).
	2. Objects are cached for the life of TTL (Time to live)
	3. You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged.

* EC2 101 Elastic Compute Cloud

	1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is just a virtual server (or servers) in the cloud
	2. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

  EC2 Pricing Models:
	1. On Demand: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
	2. Reserved: Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Contracts are 1 - 3 year terms. Higher discount with upfront payments and longer contracts.
	3. Spot: Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
	4. Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated hosts can help reduce the costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.


*EC2 Exam Tips:
	1. EC2 is a compute based service. It is not server less. It's a Server!
	2. Use a private key to connect to EC2.
	3. Common Ports: Linux (port 22), Microsoft - RDP (port 3389), HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)
	4. Security groups are virtual firewalls. To let everything in 0.0.0.0/0. To let a single IP address in X.X.X.X/32 (32 means this ip address)
	5. Always design for failure. Have one EC2 instance in each availability zone.

*Using the command line
	[root@ip-172-31-80-252 ec2-user]# aws s3 mb s3://acloudsri
	make_bucket failed: s3://acloudsri Unable to locate credentials
	[root@ip-172-31-80-252 ec2-user]# aws configure
	AWS Access Key ID [None]:  

	aws s3 mb s3://acloudsri

	cd ~/.aws
   	rm credentials

*Using the command line: Exam Tips:
	1. You can interact with AWS in 3 different ways
		a. Using the console
		b. Using the command line interface (CLI)
		c. Using the SDK's

*Using Roles: Exam Tips
	1. Roles are much more secure than using access key id's and secret access keys and are easier to manage.
	2. Adding/Modifying policies to roles are instantaneous. You can apply roles to EC2 instances anytime. When you do this, the change takes place immediately.
	3. Roles are universal. You do not need to specify what region they are in, similar to users.

* Build a web server:
	Logon to AWS
		chmod 400 SriAWS.pem
		onnect to your instance using its Public DNS:
		c2-100-26-17-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com
		Example:
		ssh -i "SriAWS.pem" ec2-user@ec2-100-26-17-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	sudo yum install http -y
        Setup index.html - Hello, this is web server 1

* EC2 Load Balancer - Exam Tips:
	1. Application Load Balancer (HTTP and HTTPS) - Layer 7 aware (make intelligent decisions).
	2. Network Load Balancer (TCP, TLS and UDP) - Extreme Performance/Static IP Addresses.
	3. Classic Load Balancer (PREVIOUS GENERATION for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP) - Test & Dev to keep costs low.

* Databases 101
	1. Relational databases on AWS - RDS:
		1.1 SQL Server
		1.2 Oracle
		1.3 Postgres
		1.4 MySQL
		1.5 Aurora
		1.6 MariaDB

	2. Exam Tips: RDS has two features
		2.1 Multi-AZ - For DR
		2.2 Read Replicas - For performance (Allows 5 copies of read replica)

	3. Non Relational Databases (JSON/No SQL) called DynamoDB
		3.1 Key Value pairs
		3.2 The columns in the table can vary, this will not affect other rows in the DB)

	4. OLTP (Online transaction processing) will differ from OLAP (Online analytics processing) in terms of the type of query you will run.

	5. AWS data warehouse database called Redshift, uses a different type of architecture from a DB perspective and infrastructure layer.

	6. ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale as in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications
	   by allowing you to retrieve the information fast, managed, in-memory cache instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
		6.1  ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines
			6.1.1 Memcached 
			6.1.2 Redis

* Auto Scaling
	1. Create a Launch Configuration
	2. Assign the launch configuration to an auto scaling group

* Let's register a domain name (Route 53)
	1. DNS Management
	2. Traffic Management
	3. Availability Monitoring
	4. Domain Registration
  
  Route 53: Exam Tips:
	1. Amazon DNS is called Route 53
	2. It's global, similar to IAM and S3
	3. You can use it to direct traffic all around the world and you can use it to register a domain name.

* Elastic Beanstalk - Exam Tips
	1. With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage application in the AWS cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications.
	   You simply upload the application, and Elastic Beanstalk handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling and application health monitoring.
	
* Cloud Formation - Exam Tips
	1. It's a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources, so that you can spend less time managing those resources, and more time focusing on your applications
	   that run in AWS. And you create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want. So this can be things like EC2 instances,
           RDS instances ... etc. And AWS CloudFormation takes care of the provisioning and configuring of those resources for you.
           You don't need to individually go in and create and configure your AWS resources like we did with our WordPress site, and figure out what's dependent on what. 
           AWS CloudFormation handles all of that for you. So, CloudFormation is fantastically powerful.
        
	2. Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation are both free services. However, just remember that the resources that they provision,
           such as EC2 instances or RDS instances ... etc are not free. So the services itself is free, but not the actual resource that it provisions.
           And then, finally, just remember that Elastic Beanstalk is limited in what it can provision and is not programmable, whereas, CloudFormation can provision almost any
           AWS services and is completely programmable.

	- Know the 6 advantages of cloud
		1. Trade Capital expense for variable expense
		2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
		3. Stop guessing about capacity.
		4. Increase speed and agility.
		5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres
		6. Go global in minutes.

	- Know the 3 different types of cloud computing
		1. Infra as a service (IAAS) - EC2

		2. Hybrid - Mixture of private and public
		3. Private Cloud (or on Premise) - You manage it in your datacenter. OpenStack or VMWare

	- Understand the difference between a region, an availability zone (AZ) and an Edge location 
		1. A region is a physical location consists of 2 or more AZ's
		2. An AZ is one or more datacenter's. Each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in seperate facilities.
		3. Edge locations are endpoints for AWS, which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).

	- Choosing the right AWS region?
		1. Data Sovereignty laws.
		2. Latency to end users.
		3. AWS Services.

	- Understand the different support packages.
		1. Basic 	- Free
		2. Developer  	- $29 per month (scales based on usage)
		3. Business   	- $100 per month (scales based on usage)
		3. Enterprise 	- $15000 per month (scales based on usage) plus TAM (Technical Account Manager)

	- Billing Alerts/Alarms will alert you automatically when a certain level of AWS spend has been reached.

	- IAM (Identify Access Management). It is Global, you do not specify a region when dealing with IAM. When you create a user or group, this is created GLOBALLY.

	- You can access the AWS platform in 3 ways
		1. Via the console
		2. Programatically (Using the command line)
		3. Using the SDK

	- Your root is the email address you used to set up your AWS account. The root account has full admin access. 
	  You should not give these account credentials away to anyone. Instead create a user for each individual within your org. 
	  You should always secure this root account using multi-factor authentication.

	- A group is simply a place to store your users. Your users will inherit all permissions that the group has. Examples of groups: Developers, Sys admins, HR, finance...etc.

	- To set the permission in the group you need to apply a policy to that group. Policies consists of JSON. These are referred to as key value pairs. You have your key such 
	  as name and then the value. For ex: {"name":"A cloud guru"}

	- Remember that S3 is Object based: I.e allows you to upload files
	- Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 TB
	- There is unlimited storage
	- Files are stored in Buckets
	- S3 is universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally. For Ex: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
	- Not suitable to install an operating system on
	- Successful uploads will generate HTTP 200 status code.
	- The Key fundamentals of S3 are:
		1. Key (this is simply the name of the object)
		2. Value (this is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
	- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
	- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETS (can take some time to propagate)
	- When you view your buckets, you view them globally but you can have buckets in individual regions.
	- You can replicate the contents of one bucket to another bucket automatically by using cross region replication.
	- S3 Transfer acceleration: Upload to an Edge location and then the files is transferred using Amazon network.
	Exam Tips:
	1. S3 Standard: 99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities
	2. S3 - IA (Infrequently accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lowe fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
	3. S3 One Zone IA: For where you want a lower cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple availability zone.
	4. S3 Intelligent Tiering: Designed to optimise costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
	5. S3 Glacier: S3 Glacier is a secure, durable and a low-cost storage class for data archiving. Retrieval times configurable from mins to hours.

	8. You can use S3 to host STATIC websites (such as .html). Websites that require database connections such as Wordpress etc cannot be hosted on S3.
	9. S3 Scales automatically to meet your demand. Many enterprises will put static websites on S3 when they think there is going to be a large number of requests (such as for a movie preview for example)

	- CloudFront - How it works with edge locations. Initial query at the edge location, if not available then it downloads from the sever. Otherwise from the edge location.
		1. Edge Location: This is the location where content will be caches. This is seperate to an AWS Region/AZ.
		2. Origin: This is the origin of all the files that CDN will distribute. This can be either a S3 Bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53.	
		3. Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge locations.
		4. Web Distribution - Typically used for Websites.
		5. RTMP - Used for Media Streaming
		6. Edge locations are not just READ only - you can write to them too. (i.e put an object on to them.)
		7. Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live)
		8. You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged.

	- EC2 Exam Tips: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provided resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.
		1. On Demand: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
		2. Reserved: Provides you with a capacity reservation and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Contract Terms are 1 year or 3 year terms.
		3. Spot: Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your application have flexible start and end times.
		   Note: If the spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.
		4. Dedicated Hosts: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

	- EC2 is compute based service. It is not server-less. It's a server!
	- Use a private key to connect to EC2
	- Common Ports: Linux (22), MDP (RDP 3389), HTTP 80, HTTPS 443
	- Firewall: TO let everything in 0.0.0.0/0. To let just one IP in X.X.X.X/32
	- Security Groups are virtual firewalls in the cloud. You need to open ports in order to use them. Popular ports are SSH (22), RDP (3389), HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)

	- Always design for failure. Have one EC2 instance in each availability zone.

* Summary of Cloud Concepts and Technology - Part II

	- With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that run those applications.
	  You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling and application health monitoring.
	- AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focussing on you applications that run in AWS. You can create template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; AWS CloudFormation handles all of that.
	- Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation are both free services, however the resources they provision (such as EC2 instances) are not free.
	- Elastic Beanstalk is limited in what it can provision and is not programmable and CloudFormation can provision almost any AWS service and is completely programmable.
